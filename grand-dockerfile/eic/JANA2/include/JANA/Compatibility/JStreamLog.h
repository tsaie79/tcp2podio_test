/// JStreamLog provides an interface for for writing messages
/// in a way that buffers them by thread to prevent multiple
/// threads from simultaneously writing to the screen (via
/// cout and cerr) causing the characters to intermix resulting
/// in gibberish.
///
/// JANA using the jout and jerr global streams by default which
/// send their output to cout and cerr respectively. In addition,
/// they can optionally prepend a special "tag" string to indicate
/// which stream the message came from. By default, these are 
/// set to "JANA >>" and "JANA ERROR>>", but are user configureable.
/// One can also turn on prepending of timestamps to be printed
/// with each line (this is off by default).
///
/// JStreamLog objects inherit from std::ostream and so can be used
/// just like cout and cerr.
///
/// Example:
///
///    jout<<"Hello World!"<<endl;
///
