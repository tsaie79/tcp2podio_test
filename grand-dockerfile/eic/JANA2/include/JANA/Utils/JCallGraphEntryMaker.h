/// Stack object to handle recording entry to call graph
///
/// This is used to add a new entry to a JCallGraph, recording the time when it is created
/// and then again when it is deleted. The intent is to use it as a local stack variable
/// so if the call being timed throws an exception, the destructor of this will still get
/// run, guaranteeing the call stack entry is completed.
///
/// Objects of this type are used in JEvent::Get and JEventProcessingArrow::execute
/// (and possibly other places).
